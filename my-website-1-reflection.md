Release 5: Reflect
Now's the time to reflect on your learning! Remember to create a feature branch! Then (using your command line) in your phase-0/week-1 directory, create a file called my-website-1-reflection.md. Open the file in sublime, copy the questions below, and add your reflection to the file. 
* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

https://github.com/chrishenderson2/chrishenderson2.github.io.git

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository on GitHub, next to your icon in the top right corner press the +

To clone a repository, take the HTML URL from github, navigate to directory where you want to put the project via CLI, then do:

git clone then the URL - hit enter - then enter git hub username and password



* Describe what open source means.

Open source means the code is public, and users are free to make modifications. 


* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

It does indeed feel like utopia, and id doesn’t make me nervous or protective. I am not a good programmer so I don’t feel like anyone would want to use my code. If it was good code that made and awesome software, I might not leave it open source. 

* Assess the importance of using licenses.

It is important to use a license. In order to have the legal right to use software to achieve the required needs, the rights and limits in the associated software license are very important. You must grant rights for others to modify software if that’s what you want, or else there could be legal issues. Also, you want to be able to control if people can make money off your code, or if they hav to make the improvements they made public, etc.



* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The git push was an aha. Sometimes it works, sometimes the CLI git just doesn’t work. Honestly, I need some help with that. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
