####1.1 Think About Time Reflection ####

* Which time management and productivityÂ ideas did you learn about?

I learned more about flow, as well as time boxing and how that can effectively help you judge how productive you are being in that time

* What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time boxing fixing a time period to work on a task or group of tasks. Instead of working on a task until it's done, you commit to work on it for a specific amount of time, and then assess your progress when the time is up. 

* How do you manage your time currently?

I keep a calendar
time box within each hour randomly throughout day


* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

Yes it is working, but there are also a lot of mosquito tasks that come up and suck time away.

having a time and a place for everything really helps me.

* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?


I will be employing all of them. Some of these strategies I try to use already, such as practicing mindfulness and meditation, pomodoros, etc. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

work on it during the afternoons, as well as evenings
time box for an hour
do pomodoro technique
practice meditation and exercise  more
