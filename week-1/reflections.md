####1.1 Think About Time Reflection ####

* Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

I learned more about flow, as well as time boxing and how that can effectively help you judge how productive you are being in that time

* What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time boxing fixing a time period to work on a task or group of tasks. Instead of working on a task until it's done, you commit to work on it for a specific amount of time, and then assess your progress when the time is up. 

* How do you manage your time currently?

I keep a calendar
time box within each hour randomly throughout day


* Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

Yes it is working, but there are also a lot of mosquito tasks that come up and suck time away.

having a time and a place for everything really helps me.

* Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?


I will be employing all of them. Some of these strategies I try to use already, such as practicing mindfulness and meditation, pomodoros, etc. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

work on it during the afternoons, as well as evenings
time box for an hour
do pomodoro technique
practice meditation and exercise  more






####1.2 The Command Line Reflection ####

What is a shell? What is "bash?"



the shell is a program that takes your commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In the old days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix computer.

Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell, released in 1989

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

It just takes time getting used to going from a GUI to CLI 

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

I was able to use all of the commands 


In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?


-pwd
-ls
-cd
-touch
-help


Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.


-pwd  print working directory
-ls list dir
-mv move file
-cd change directory
-../  go back one step in the command line
-touch  make empty file
-mkdir  make directory 
-less  page through a file
-rmdir remove directory
-rm  remove
-help  access help menu
 






####1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection  ####



* If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

To create a new repository, press the plus sign by your user icon in Git Hub

To fork a repository, press the fork button in the upper right hand corner when viewing a project on Git Hub. This makes a personal copy, so you work on your copy instead of the group copy.

To clone a repository, take the HTML URL from github, navigate to directory where you want to put the project via CLI, then do:

git clone then the URL - hit enter - then enter git hub username and password


* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

 I already had installed git on my computer luckily. GitHub makes it easy to setup, and create projects. The most interesting thing about the process is the fact that what is on GitHub can be also stored locally and you can access it via the CLI
